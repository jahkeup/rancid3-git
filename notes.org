   I must admit took much of the work you did and ported it over to
   the rancid 3 release. 

* Notable Changes
** Git is default RCSSYS
   Change made in [[file:bin/control_rancid.in::RCSSYS%3D${RCSSYS:%3D}%3B][control_rancid.in]]
** HTML Mail doesn't work with MAXSZ, don't use it with HTMLMAILS=YES

* Notes

** Make (install) must be called from the top level dir
   The script was referencing $srcdir/configure.vers before but that
   didn't work. I've hardcoded ./configure.vers for now.

** Bash is required by rancid-cvs & control_rancid

* Tasks

** TODO Get pygments working for cvs and svn
   Need to get someone who actually uses cvs or svn to help out
   here. I don't use these.
